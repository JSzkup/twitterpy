I still can't get over how excited my kids were to see Cat in the Hat last week! They waved to him every time we passed in the hallway. #WeAreMG

We used our creativity and imagination to help us think about what we would do if the Cat in the Hat came to our house! #greathappenshere19_20

One of the best parts of Pre-K...their faces when they saw their teacher as " The Cat in the Hat"

We made the cat hat out of strawberries and bananas, after we found “The Cat in the Hat” in the computer room. #Day2ReadAcrossAmericaWeek
