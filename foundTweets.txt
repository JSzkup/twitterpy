Immunity testing will be key. “These “serology tests” are aimed at those who were very sick and got better, those who had mild symptoms and those who never felt sick at all— may have disease-fighting antibodies that give them some immunity to #COVID19.”
Testing coronavirus survivors’ blood could help reopen America
Serology tests that measure coronavirus antibodies could restart society, but this will require accurate, widespread testing and more information about immunity.

Hold up so impeachment distracted Trump from the coronavirus.  

By that logic, shouldn't the coronavirus distract trump from the wall, war with Iran or any other non- coronavirus related issues?

Make it make sense.\n

Another quick update from me on our campaign against #coronavirus.

You are saving lives by staying at home, so I urge you to stick with it this weekend, even if we do have some fine weather.

As a Brit, I warmly applaud #Australia for booting out entitled British #backpackers.

There’s a simple life lesson for millenials here:

DO AS YOU’RE FUCKING WELL TOLD.

The only time I go out in public during this stay at home order, is to get food and house stuff for my family and parents. I ordered my parents to not leave the house. If I get sick taking care of my family, it is worth it! 
I say prayers every night for this to be over! #COVID19\n

We must no longer allow corporations like

 to manufacture critical supplies in China. If you want to manufacture in China, your IP should be forfeit to the United States taxpayer and you should be expelled as a corporation from the U.S. #boycott3M #3Mtreason #COVID19\n

The US is being accused of "modern piracy" and "hijacking" medical supplies meant for France, Canada, Germany, and Brazil

The mask of US "global leadership" has come off, revealing the ruthless empire for all to see.
