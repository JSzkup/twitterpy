Immunity testing will be key. “These “serology tests” are aimed at those who were very sick and got better, those who had mild symptoms and those who never felt sick at all— may have disease-fighting antibodies that give them some immunity to #COVID19.”
Testing coronavirus survivors’ blood could help reopen America
Serology tests that measure coronavirus antibodies could restart society, but this will require accurate, widespread testing and more information about immunity.

Hold up so impeachment distracted Trump from the coronavirus.  

By that logic, shouldn't the coronavirus distract trump from the wall, war with Iran or any other non- coronavirus related issues?

I thought they could only focus on one thing at a time. 

Make it make sense.\n

Here's a fun exercise for Aussies:
1) Think about how many different people live in your state or territory
2) Think about the broad variety of daily physical encounters each has with other humans
3) Think about the broad variety of reasons for which those encounters happen

You do realize that it was a group of South Korean Church goers who unleashed this on the world. Outside of China.https://nytimes.com/2020/02/21/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-shincheonji.html… #StayAtHome #SocialDistancing #coronavirus
Shadowy Church Is at Center of Coronavirus Outbreak in South Korea
As the country’s infection numbers soar, most cases have been connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which mainstream churches consider a cult.
