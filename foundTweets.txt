The World Health Org response to #COVID19 was imperfect, but it was FAR better than the Trump administration's response. The WHO promptly rolled out a test that worked; the US still lacks enough tests, is still short PPE. So, Mr. President, careful about demanding accountability!

Trump accuses the WHO of "severely mismanaging and covering up" the coronavirus crisis. He says the US "has a duty to insist on full accountability." He criticizes the WHO for opposing travel restrictions. He touts his own restrictions on China.

The rise in new cases is as a success of our house-to-house contact tracing and ramping up of tests across 20 LGAs.
